#EasyToDo - Android Task Management App

EasyToDo is a straightforward Android application designed for managing tasks. It offers essential features such as adding, updating, and deleting tasks, along with the ability to filter tasks based on their status. The primary objective of this application is to provide a practical example of writing unit, integrated, and end-to-end test cases. Notably, it focuses on testing Jetpack Compose components, which make up the app's user interface.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies have been employed in the development of EasyToDo:

1. **Kotlin**: The entire application is written in Kotlin for modern Android development.

2. **Jetpack Compose**: Jetpack Compose is used to create the app's user interface, enabling a more declarative and efficient UI development approach.

3. **Hilt**: Hilt is employed for dependency injection, simplifying the management of app dependencies.

4. **Room**: Room is used for local database management, ensuring efficient and reliable data storage.

5. **JUnit 4**: JUnit 4 is utilized for writing unit tests, while the Dagger Hilt test library aids in creating fake Hilt modules for testing purposes.

6. **Compose UI Test**: The Compose UI test library facilitates UI testing, ensuring the app's user interface functions correctly.

7. **Google Truth**: The Google Truth library enhances assertion capabilities, making tests more informative and readable.
